#Title: Username Creator

-------------------------------------

#Description

Username Creator is a small project developed during my journey to learn the C language. This program facilitates the creation of 
usernames with various checks, including:

1. Maximum Character Limit: Ensures that usernames are created within a specified character limit.
2. Special Character Check: Prohibits the use of special characters in the username.
3. Minimum Character Limit: Detects if the username falls below a specified character limit.
4. Minimum Alphabetical Character Check: Requires a minimum number of alphabets for creating a username.
5. Email Address Concatenation: Appends a custom email address after generating the username.

-------------------------------------

#Things to improve: User Interface and experience.

-------------------------------------

#Project Structure
1. SOURCE:
>> Main.c: Serves as the entry point for the program.
>> Helper.c: Contains all the functions.

2. HEADER:
>> Define.h: Holds all the definitions. Many program configurations, such as special character ranges, minimum character limits, 
   required minimum alphabets, and username character limits, can be adjusted here.
>> Helper.h: Provides the definitions for all functions.

-------------------------------------

#How to Run the Program:
Open UsernameCreator.exe to execute the program.
